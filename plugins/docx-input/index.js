// A builder for corpora of structured Word documents: parses Heading 1/2/3-
// structured .docx files into Collections/DocumentParts/Chapters
// (docx_crate.js, in this folder) instead of generic-input's flat file scan.
//
// An ordinary plugin, gated by an ordinary option. What makes it a *builder*
// is that it taps crate:build inside the builder band (priority <= 10) and
// sets ctx.crate. It sits at 5, below generic-input's 10, so when its option
// is on it wins the band: generic-input stands down for the whole build, its
// folder scan included, and the annotating taps at 20+ run against the crate
// this one produced. Nothing here knows generic-input exists; the priority is
// the whole of the arrangement.
//
// docx_crate.js pulls in mammoth + cheerio (heavy deps), so it's only
// dynamically imported here when the option is actually on — keeps it out of
// the main bundle and in its own chunk regardless of this plugin ever being
// used in a given session. It also needs one collection2crate core function
// (writeFileAtPath) — createPlugin(deps) holds onto deps and hands it to
// docx_crate.js's configure() once the dynamic import resolves, rather than
// importing fs_helpers.js directly (see this repo's README).
// Mirrors docx_crate.js's own (module-private) OUTPUT_FILES_DIR_NAME — kept
// as a literal here rather than imported, since importing docx_crate.js
// statically would defeat the whole point of dynamic-importing it below (it
// evaluates its mammoth/cheerio imports regardless of which export is used).

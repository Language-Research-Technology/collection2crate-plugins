# SentimentExplorer plugin specification

Implement a visualisation-only plugin named `sentimentexplorer`. It is the
JavaScript counterpart of LADAL's `SentimentExplorer` Shiny app in
`/Users/moises/source/github/LADAL/tools/sentimentexplorer/app.R`.

The current `index.js` is deliberately a blank, valid plugin placeholder. This
file is the behavior contract for the implementation that replaces it.

## Plugin contract

- Export `createPlugin()` from `index.js`.
- Return `{ name: "sentimentexplorer", visualisation: { ... } }`.
- The plugin must declare no hooks and must not run during a build.
- The visualisation label should be `Sentiment Explorer` and its hint should
  explain that it annotates text with the NRC word-emotion lexicon and
  summarises the result per section.
- Implement the pure analysis functions as exported functions, preferably
  `annotateSection(words, sectionName, lexicon)` and
  `buildSummary(annotatedRows)`, so the counting and percentage behavior can
  be tested without a DOM.
- Read the host-provided `ctx.documents`; do not upload files or read the
  filesystem directly.
- Tokenise the same way as the other panels here (Unicode-aware words, not
  `[A-Za-z0-9]`), lowercased unconditionally — the R app always lowercases
  before matching, and there is no case-sensitivity option to preserve.

## The NRC lexicon

The analysis is driven entirely by the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon
(Mohammad & Turney, 2013): a table mapping a word to zero or more of ten
categories — `anger`, `anticipation`, `disgust`, `fear`, `joy`, `sadness`,
`surprise`, `trust`, `negative`, `positive`. A word can belong to several
categories at once (e.g. "excellent" → `joy`, `positive`, `trust`); a word
absent from the lexicon belongs to none.

The lexicon itself is **not free to redistribute for commercial use** — the R
app ships a `nrc_lexicon.csv` the maintainer generates separately from the
raw NRC release, and shows an explicit error banner when it is missing rather
than silently analysing nothing. This plugin must do the same:

- Load the lexicon from its own data file in this folder (e.g.
  `nrc-lexicon.json`, mirroring how `austlang/austlang-data.json` is a
  bundled, offline data pack next to its plugin's `index.js`).
- Dynamically import that data file only when the panel actually renders or
  runs an analysis, the way `austlang`'s matcher and data pack are imported
  only when its option is on — so no build that never opens this panel pays
  for the lexicon's size.
- If the data file is missing or fails to load, render a clear error state
  explaining that the NRC lexicon is not bundled, linking to
  `https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm`, and noting the
  license: free for research and educational use, commercial use requires
  permission from the lexicon's author. Do not attempt any analysis in this
  state.
- Do not commit the actual lexicon data as part of implementing this spec
  without first confirming its license permits bundling in this repository;
  that confirmation is a prerequisite of the implementation task, not
  something to assume.

## Controls

The panel should provide:

1. **File selector.** A multi-select listing every available source file, all
   selected by default (every loaded file is a section unless narrowed down).
   The selected sources limit every downstream step (sections, tokenisation,
   analysis) to their documents.
2. **CSV/TSV column selector, one per selected table.** For each currently
   selected file that is a CSV or TSV table, show its own multi-select
   listing that table's columns — not one shared list — so two selected
   files can each contribute a different named column (e.g. file A's `note`,
   file B's `translation`). Each selected column's cell values are joined per
   row to build that row's text; select that table's own `text` column by
   default when it has one, otherwise select every column of that table.
   Hide the whole column area when no selected file is tabular. Selecting a
   table source (with or without a column change) collapses that file's rows
   into documents that all share one `source` — the file name — so by
   default they form a single section. This plugin's own
   `documentsForSelection(documents, tables, sources, columns)` accepts a
   single source or an array of sources for `sources`, and for `columns`
   accepts either an array (the same column names applied to every selected
   table, matching `collocation`'s function of the same name for a single
   source) or a `Map<source, string[]>` for per-file column selection.
3. **Section assignment.** Every distinct source in the *current* working
   document set (i.e. after the file/column selection above is applied)
   starts as its own section, named after that source. Show one text input
   per such source so a person can rename a section, or give two or more
   sources the same name to merge them into one section before analysis —
   mirroring the R app's per-file section-name inputs, adapted to
   per-source-file rather than per-upload. Changing the file or column
   selection rebuilds this list and discards any previous analysis, since it
   no longer describes the same working documents.
4. **Category filter.** Checkboxes for the ten NRC categories, all selected by
   default, controlling which columns/series the chart, summary table and
   token table show. It filters what is displayed, not what is computed.
5. **Run button** ("Analyse" or similar). Do not recompute on every keystroke
   or checkbox change to the section names; recompute the annotation when
   pressed. The category filter may re-render existing results without a
   fresh Run, since it only changes what is displayed.

The panel should clearly report: no documents loaded, the lexicon failed to
load, and a valid run that annotated zero tokens.

## Tokenisation and corpus

For each section, concatenate the text of every document whose source maps to
that section, in document order, then tokenise into Unicode-aware words
(same token pattern as `ngrams`/`collocation`: `\p{L}\p{M}\p{N}` with an
optional internal apostrophe or hyphen), lowercased unconditionally.

Sections are independent corpora: a token index only orders words within its
own section, and no token crosses a section boundary.

## Per-token annotation

For each section, produce one row per token:

`section`, `token_index` (1-based position within the section), `word`, and
one column per NRC category holding `1` if the lexicon lists that word under
that category, else `0`. A word not in the lexicon has every category column
`0`.

## Summary

For each section, produce one row with:

- `section`
- `total_tokens` — the token count for that section
- for each of the ten categories: a count of tokens where that category is
  `1`, and that count as a percentage of `total_tokens` (rounded to one
  decimal place, matching the R app)

## Results panel

After a run, show stat chips: number of sections, total tokens across all
sections, and the number and percentage of tokens matching at least one
category. Provide:

- A bar chart, one facet/section per group, showing each visible category's
  percentage of that section's tokens, following this repo's existing
  hand-built DOM/SVG approach (no chart library — see `chart` and
  `collocation` for precedent). Each bar's label should show both the count
  and the percentage, as the R app's does.
- A summary table: one row per section, with total tokens and, for each
  visible category, its count and percentage columns.
- A token table: one row per token, showing its section, token index, word,
  and a 1/0 (or clearer visual equivalent) for each visible category.
  Sortable and filterable, as the other panels' result tables are.
- A citation panel or note pointing to the NRC lexicon citation (Mohammad &
  Turney, 2013, DOI `10.1111/j.1467-8640.2012.00460.x`) and this tool's own
  citation, since the lexicon's license requires attribution.
- A parameter view recording the section names and their source mappings,
  and the selected categories, for reproducibility.

Use the host vocabulary from `src/_panel.js` and the shared CSV helpers in
`src/_csv.js`. Do not write analysis output into the selected crate output
directory — visualisation results are copied or downloaded, never filed as
crate content (SPEC-PLUGINS.md).

## Exports

Following this repo's other visualisation panels (no Excel dependency here):

- Copy or download the summary table as CSV.
- Copy or download the full token table as CSV — every row, not only what is
  rendered.
- Download the analysis parameters as a plain-text record.
- Chart image export (PNG/PDF) is optional and only worth adding if the
  chosen rendering approach supports it cleanly; otherwise leave it as a
  documented follow-up rather than shipping a misleading export.

## Testable seam

Add focused tests, once implemented, for:

- Unicode tokenisation and unconditional lowercasing.
- A word mapping to multiple categories at once.
- A word absent from the lexicon annotating as all zeros.
- Per-section token indexing that never crosses a section boundary.
- Merging two sources into one section by matching section names.
- Summary counts and percentages against hand-worked small examples.
- The missing-lexicon state producing no analysis and a clear message.
- `documentsForSelection`: `All files` returns every document unchanged; a
  plain-text/CHAT source is filtered by source; a CSV/TSV source combines its
  selected columns per row into one document, defaulting to the `text`
  column when present.

The plugin should be registered in the package registry as
`sentimentexplorer`, matching this folder's name, the same way `collocation`
is registered next to its own visualisation implementation.

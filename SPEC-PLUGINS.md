# Analysis plugins

Three panels for collection2crate's Visualise page. Two are ports from
chaos2crate's `src/analysis-plugins/` — a concordance (KWIC) explorer and an
n-gram analyser — and the third is the chart UI that lives in the host's
`main.js` today, moved out here to sit alongside them. None of the three exists
in this repo yet; this is what they should be when they do.

They are not build plugins. A build plugin taps the pipeline, mutates `ctx` and
writes files; these read text that a build already produced and let a person
explore it — interactive panels on collection2crate's Visualise page, doing
nothing until someone types in them. Everything below follows from that one
difference.

## The contract

A plugin declares analysis the way it declares anything else — as a member on
the same registry entry, in the one `REGISTRY`:

```js
export function createPlugin(deps) {
  return {
    name: "concordance",
    analysis: {
      label: "Concordance (KWIC)",
      hint: "Search for a word or phrase and see every occurrence in context.",
      render(container, ctx) { /* … */ },
    },
  };
}
```

- `label` names the panel in the Visualise sidebar; `hint` is the one-line
  description shown with it.
- `render(container, ctx)` builds the panel's DOM inside `container`, an empty
  element the host owns. It is called each time the panel is shown, and may be
  called again when the loaded documents change; it must not assume it is the
  first call, and must not retain anything between calls except through `ctx`.
- `ctx` carries `{ documents, tables, log }` — the two views of the loaded data
  described below, and the host's logger for anything worth putting in the
  build log.

A plugin may declare `analysis` alongside `hooks`, or on its own. These two
declare no hooks at all: they never run during a build, so they register
nothing on the bus, and `registerAllPlugins` skips them as it already skips any
plugin with no `hooks`. No second registry, no separate selection mechanism —
a deployment that leaves a plugin out of `PLUGINS` gets neither its taps nor
its panel.

## The documents

`ctx.documents` is a flat list, one entry per line, row or utterance:

```js
{ id: "_outputs/csv/interview-01.csv#12",  // path + row, unique
  source: "_outputs/csv/interview-01.csv", // for display and grouping
  speaker: "CHI",                          // "" when the format has none
  text: "the actual line of text" }
```

Flat, not nested by file, because both plugins iterate the corpus and report
which source each result came from. One line per entry, not one per file, is
what makes n-grams stop at line boundaries rather than running across an
utterance break (see below).

Loading is the **host's** job, not a plugin's: collection2crate owns the folder
handle, and one picker on the page serves every panel.

**That picker lists output directories, not files.** The choices are the
directories plugins declared as `outputPaths` — `_outputs/csv/` (ca-data-prep),
`_outputs/chat/` (chat-export), `_outputs/logs/` — named as what produced them
rather than as a list of filenames. A corpus build writes hundreds of files
whose names change with every source document; the handful of folders they land
in does not, and "the CSVs the transcript processing made" is the choice a
person is actually making. Picking one loads every supported file in it.

The three shapes the loader reads:

| Extension | Parsed as | `speaker` from |
|---|---|---|
| `.csv` | a `text` column, or every cell joined when there is none | a `speakerId`/`speaker` column, if present |
| `.cha` | CHAT utterance lines (`*CHI:\t…`); `@`-prefixed header lines are metadata, not text | the tier label |
| anything else | one non-empty line per document | — |

A directory is only offered when it exists *and* holds a supported file, so a
declared output holding HTML or images never appears as a dead option — and a
panel never has to render an empty state for a folder that could never have had
anything in it.

### `ctx.tables` — the same CSVs, unflattened

Flattening a CSV to one line of text per row is what the text panels want and
what a chart panel cannot use: a chart needs the columns back.

```js
{ source: "_outputs/csv/interview-01.csv",
  header: ["speakerId", "start", "end", "text"],
  rows: [["CHI", "0.0", "2.4", "the actual line"], …] }
```

So the host parses each CSV once and offers both views of it: `tables` for
anything that reads columns, `documents` for anything that reads running text.
A `.cha` or `.txt` source produces documents only and never appears in
`tables` — there are no columns to offer.

## What collection2crate has to add

Host-side work this spec depends on, none of it done yet:

- `composeAnalysisPanels()` in `src/plugins/index.js`, alongside
  `composeOptionSchema()` and the others, returning every plugin's `analysis`
  member in registry order.
- A Visualise page that is nothing but a panel host: the output-directory
  picker and the composed panels in its left rail, the chosen panel rendered in
  the right column. It holds no analysis of its own.
- One loaded set of data shared by every panel. Switching panels does not
  reload, and a panel never picks files for itself — which is also what makes
  running the same corpus through two panels a comparison rather than a
  coincidence.
- The loader described above, in the host rather than in a plugin, producing
  both `documents` and `tables`.
- **Moving the chart UI out of `main.js`** into the `chart` plugin below. It is
  the page's own content today — the file list, the chart-type and axis
  selects, `drawChart()` and its SVG helpers, roughly 150 lines around
  `refreshVisualiseView()`. Once the page is a panel host, a built-in chart
  would be the one panel that arrived by a different route and could not be
  deselected from a deployment; there is no reason for it to be the exception.

## Shared helpers

`src/_csv.js` in this repo, next to `_progress.js`: `csvField(value)` (quote
when the value holds a comma, quote or newline; double any quote),
`buildCsvText(header, rows)`, and `downloadCsv(filename, text)`. Both plugins
offer the same two result actions and must escape identically.

Results are **copied or downloaded, never written into the folder**. Analysis
is exploratory — a person tries twenty searches and keeps one — and a plugin
that wrote each attempt into `_outputs/` would be filing drafts as crate
content. If a particular analysis is worth keeping, it belongs in the crate by
a deliberate act, which is a separate feature from either of these.

## Styling

Use the host's existing vocabulary — `.field`, `.actions`, `.button`,
`.data-table`, `.table-scroll`, `.empty-note`, `.mono` — rather than
plugin-specific class names. chaos2crate's versions carried their own `kwic-*`
and `ngram-*` CSS, which is why they looked like guests on the page. Anything
genuinely specific to a panel (the keyword column's centring, the numeric
columns' alignment) is a handful of rules the plugin ships with its own
prefixed class.

## concordance

Keyword-in-context: find every match of a search term across the loaded
documents and show it with a few words of context either side. Follows the
[LADAL concordancing tutorial](https://ladal.edu.au/tutorials/concordancing/).

**Controls.** A query box and Search button (Enter searches too), three
checkboxes — case sensitive, whole word, regex — and a context size in words,
1–20, default 5.

**Matching.** The query is escaped to a literal unless *regex* is on, wrapped
in `\b…\b` when *whole word* is on (and not regex), and compiled with `g`, plus
`i` unless *case sensitive*. A zero-length match advances the index by one
rather than looping forever. An invalid pattern reports the engine's own
message next to the query box and leaves the previous results alone.

**Context.** Take the raw text either side of the match, split on whitespace,
and keep the last N words on the left and the first N on the right. Character
slicing then word trimming, rather than tokenising each document up front:
same window, far less work, and it keeps the keyword exactly as it appeared.

**Results.** A table of source, speaker, left context, keyword, right context.
Sort by left or by right context (the two orderings a concordance is read in),
and copy or save as CSV with those five columns; the saved file is
`concordance-<slug of query>.csv`. At most 2000 rows are rendered, with the
count stating both numbers when it is capped — exports carry every match.

**Testable seam.** `search(documents, query, options) → rows`, pure and
exported: matching, context windows, the zero-length guard and the regex
failure path are all reachable without a DOM.

## ngrams

Contiguous word sequences ranked by frequency, with association measures for
bigrams. Follows the [LADAL collocations
tutorial](https://ladal.edu.au/tutorials/collocations/collocations.html).

**Controls.** N-gram size 1–5 (default 2), minimum frequency (default 2), an
Analyze button, case-sensitive and remove-stopwords checkboxes, and a filter
box that narrows the rendered rows without recomputing.

**Tokenising.** Letters, marks and digits, with an optional internal apostrophe
or hyphen: `/[\p{L}\p{M}\p{N}]+(?:['’-][\p{L}\p{M}\p{N}]+)*/gu`. Punctuation is
dropped rather than kept as a token. **This differs from chaos2crate's
`[A-Za-z0-9]+`**, which silently drops every non-ASCII letter — unusable for
the orthographies this tool exists to serve. Lowercased unless *case sensitive*.

**Counting.** Every n-gram, plus every unigram and the token total regardless
of `n`, since the bigram measures need them. **An n-gram never spans two
documents**: each entry is its own utterance or line, so the window slides
within one and stops at its end. Rows below the minimum frequency are dropped,
as are rows containing a stopword when that option is on.

**Association measures**, bigrams only, where `O` is the pair's count, `f1`/`f2`
the two words' unigram counts and `N` the token total:

```
expected = f1 * f2 / N
MI       = log2(O / expected)          # null when expected is 0
t-score  = (O - expected) / sqrt(O)
```

The tutorial's third measure, log-ratio, is `log2((O/N)/(E/N))` — algebraically
identical to `log2(O/E)`, the same number as MI — so it is not offered as a
separate column.

**Stopwords.** A short list of English function words, enough to take `the of a`
out of a frequency list. It is English and nothing else, so **the option
defaults to off and is labelled "Remove English stopwords"** — the opposite of
chaos2crate, where it defaults on. Dropping `ngu`, `kari` or `yi` from an
Australian language corpus because they collide with an English list is a worse
failure than a noisy first page of results, and it is invisible to whoever hit
Analyze.

**Results.** A table of n-gram and count, plus MI and t-score columns when
`n` is 2; sort by frequency, and by MI or t-score when those columns exist.
Copy or save as CSV — `ngrams-n<N>.csv` — carrying whichever columns are shown.
Same 2000-row render cap and full-set export as the concordance.

**Testable seam.** `analyzeNgrams(documents, options) → rows`, pure and
exported: counting, the document boundary, the frequency and stopword filters,
and both measures against hand-worked numbers.

## chart

The tabular chart that is the Visualise page today: pick a CSV, pick a chart
type and two columns, get an SVG.

**Controls.** A select naming the tables in `ctx.tables` — a chosen directory
can hold many CSVs and a chart draws one at a time — then chart type (bar, line,
scatter) and two column selects, category/x and value/y, populated from that
table's header. The panel picks among what is loaded; it does not browse the
folder.

**Rendering.** Hand-built SVG, no chart library: axes, ticks, and one mark per
row. Bars for `bar`, a polyline for `line`, circles with a larger invisible hit
target for `scatter`. Non-numeric values in the y column are skipped rather
than coerced to zero, and the panel says how many rows it skipped — a column of
`"n/a"` silently plotting as a floor of zeroes is a chart that lies.

**Below the chart**, the chosen table as a plain data table, so the numbers
behind a shape are one glance away.

**Empty state.** When `ctx.tables` is empty — the chosen directory holds text
but no CSV, or nothing is chosen yet — the panel says which option produces
tabular output rather than just reporting nothing.

**Testable seam.** The scale and tick arithmetic — the part that is wrong in
silence — as a pure function over `{ rows, xColumn, yColumn, width, height }`,
returning the positions the SVG is drawn from. The drawing itself stays
untested, as DOM.

## Open questions

- **Should a corpus's own language decide the stopword list?** The crate knows
  its subject languages when AUSTLANG ran. Defaulting the list off is the
  conservative answer until there is a real one.
- **Whether `.log.txt` files should be offered at all.** They are ca-data-prep's
  processing logs, not corpus text, and searching them concordance-style is
  meaningless. Excluding by name is easy but arbitrary; leaving them in offers
  a person a choice they can't evaluate.

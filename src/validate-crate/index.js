// Runs the selected MASP profile's validator against the built crate and
// logs pass/fail — automatic whenever a profile is selected, no
// optionSchema. ro-crate-masp is a heavy dependency (pulls in the whole
// validator library), so it's still dynamically imported here, same as
// before this was extracted from processFolder — deps.loadMasp is a thunk
// chaos2crate hands in (`() => import("../masp.js")`) rather than a
// direct import, so masp.js stays dynamically imported from chaos2crate's
// own tree and this package never statically references it. See this
// repo's README for the createPlugin(deps) contract.
